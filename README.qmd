Create a spatial polygon (`sf`) delineating the ground extent (AKA wireframe or
field of view) of a nadir photo taken from an airplane or drone.
Useful in approximating the locations and total area sampled in a series of
aerial photos.

## How to Install
From GitHub:
```
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/WyoGFD/aerialPhotoFrame")
```

## Input
+ Photos which contain EXIF metadata specifying the GPS location of the camera
(X, Y, Z coordinates) when the photo was taken, the photo timestamp, and
information about the photo's aspect ratio and field of view with the camera's
sensor dimensions and lens focal length.

## Output
+ An `sf` object approximating the area photographed in each photo.

## General Workflow
+ `extractPoints` - Extract camera location (3D point) from photos, and
approximate the direction of travel (and therefore photo orientation) from the
sequence of photo locations.
+ `calcAlt` - Download a digital elevation model (DEM) for the
study area and calculate the camera's approximate altitude above ground level
based on the camera's altitude above mean sea level (what the GPS records) and 
the ground elevation (from the DEM).
+ `wireFrame` - Use EXIF-provided camera and lens specifications, altitude,
and direction of travel to construct rectangular wireframe of each photo's
ground extent

## Key Dependencies
+ The EXIF data associated with photos is read using the `exifr` package, which
calls [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/)
+ The DEM for the study area is downloaded using the `FedData` package, which
obtains DEMs from the [USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED)](https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program).

## Example
The package contains 5 example aerial photos collected in Southern Wyoming in
February 2025.  They are located in the `extdata` folder of the installed
package (e.g., `C:/Users/jadcarlisle/Documents/R/aerialPhotoFrame/extdata`).

```{r}

# Load package
library(aerialPhotoFrame)

# Path to installed package to access example images
packagePath <- "C:/Users/jadcarlisle/Documents/R/aerialPhotoFrame"

# Extract camera location from photos
pts <- extractPoints(file.path(packagePath,
                               "extdata"))

# View first few rows
head(data.frame(sf::st_drop_geometry(pts)))

# Map
plot(sf::st_geometry(pts))
```
```{r}

# Add altitude, specifically above-ground-level
pts <- calcAltitude(pts)

# View first few rows
# Note new columns starting within elev
head(data.frame(sf::st_drop_geometry(pts)))

# Histogram of camera altitudes above ground level
hist(pts$elevAGL,
     main = "Histogram of Camera Altitudes",
     xlab = "Altitude above ground level")

```


```{r}
# Create wireframe of each photo's field of view (the area of the ground photographed)
# Output in NAD 83 Zone 12N (EPSG 26912)
wires <- wireFrame(pts, crs = 26912)

# Map
plot(sf::st_geometry(wires))

```
